# Advanced-CSS-Portfolio

## Description

My motivation for this project was to make my first website from scratch. I built this for future me to see how much I progress in my coding journey. This solves an experience issue with myself and an issue with not having my very own website. I learned a lot about flexbox, the importance of having semantic and clean html code, also I'm learning constantly on different ways to establish new layouts with all the properties of CSS and some in HTML.
